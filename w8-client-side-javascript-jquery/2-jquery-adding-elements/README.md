# CryptoWallet

## Instructions

- We need to register a click event handler on the coin buttons with jQuery.

* When one of the bitcoin is clicked, a dollar emoji  (' ðŸ’µ ') should appear right underneath the button inside (in the balance class) that was clicked.
* Both buttons should not increase both balance at the same time.
* You might need to use either `this` or `event.target` in your code.
